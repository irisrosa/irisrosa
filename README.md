### Hi! ðŸ˜Š

I'm a full-stack javascript developer with many years of experience working in different industries, from art & design to fintech.

I have a dynamic and curious mindset and love to experiment with new tools that can make work more practical and more fun.

My main expertise is javascript/typescript, using React and Node on a daily basis, but my interest gravitates towards frontend development where I can see the users interacting with my work.
 
I'm a creative problem solver, independent with a collaborative attitude.
